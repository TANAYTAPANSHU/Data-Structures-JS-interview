Last-In-First-Out type of service data storage scheme is called a Stack.
we would have to implement the push() method that pushes JavaScript objects at the top of the stack; 
and pop() method, that removes the JavaScript object that's at the top of the stack at the current moment.

Here we have a stack of homework assignments represented as an array: "BIO12" is at the base, and "PSY44" is at the top of the stack.

Modify the given array and treat it like a stack using the JavaScript methods mentioned above. Remove the top element "PSY44" from the stack. Then add "CS50" to be the new top element of the stack.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
var homeworkStack = ["BIO12","HIS80","MAT122","PSY44"];
// Only change code below this line
homeworkStack.pop();
homeworkStack.push("CS50");
